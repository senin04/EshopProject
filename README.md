# E-commerce product page

This is a solution to a [Frontend Mentor](https://frontendmentor.io/) challenge.

ItÂ´s simple e-commerce product page. Project was created without using figma or sketch version, so the design is purely based on pictures.

This project was created by using CSS, HTML and Javascript. Making this project was fun and I learned a lot.

The layout is fully responsive.
